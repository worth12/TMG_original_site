&#8220;McGarey Management Group has been a wonderful collaborator and key contributor to Archstone. We have had the pleasure of working with Denver and his group in various capacities and have found them an industrious, creative, and capable partner. Their ability to seamlessly integrate into our project team - particularly for large scale mixed use urban redevelopments - has been extremely helpful and their consistent enthusiasm is always appreciated.
<br><br>
In particular, McGarey Management Group joined our team in 2008 to help redevelop a 50 acre mixed use project in Anaheim, known as 57 Centrum. The development program includes a regional lifestyle retail center, two hotels, an office tower, 500 luxury apartment units, and parking to accommodate each use. Situated next to Angel Stadium and adjacent to an Amtrak commuter rail, the importance of &#8220;place-making&#8221; is essential and McGarey Management Group has been vital to that end. With multiple stakeholders, including the City of Anaheim, the Angels organization, Amtrak, multiple community groups, private citizens, and an ongoing EIR/CEQA review, the entitlement process has been incredibly complex and challenging. However, McGarey Management Group has been a steadfast partner and continues to assist in pushing the project forward.
<br><br>
<b>In all instances and occasions where McGarey Management Group has worked with Archstone, we have found the partnership to be fruitful and would recommend their services unequivocally.&#8221;</b>

&#8220;Denver and I spent the better part of three years working closely on Atlantic Station in Atlanta, Georgia, for AIG where I got to know and respect him: we subsequently worked together on two other projects. While principally on the leasing end of development, Denver's skills and knowledge of our business are far wider and deeper, possessing a wealth of experience which enables him to make important contributions to project vision, design and market position. <b>Denver and his associates are a masterful leasing team: they have been on the cutting edge of the evolution of the mall business into the many variations that exist today, especially mixed use.&#8221;</b>

&#8220;After the decades that I have spent developing projects across the country, I can say that Denver has my great respect as someone who consistently exhibits his enthusiasm and commitment to creating the highest quality projects. Denver has a deep understanding of retail as a driving force for future development and growth that serves clients, tenants, customers and communities to create projects of lasting value.
<br><br>
Denver and the organization he leads have the unique ability to rise to the challenge and go beyond the status quo to successfully deliver projects that are often referred to as &#8220;the Next Generation&#8221; in shopping center development. <b>While he takes lessons from the past, Denver's commitment and vision will continue to serve his business and the industry as we proceed into the future.&#8221;</b>

&#8220;I have known and collaborated with F. Denver McGarey for over fourteen years. His knowledge, insight, experience and wisdom for our industry in unsurpassed. I have personally collaborated on the design of many mixed-use urban retail projects with Denver and have found the experience fulfilling, always creative and educational. <b>While his knowledge and concern has been directed towards the success of the retailers, Denver has never lost sight of the civic and cultural contributions that these retail amenities provide for our communities.&#8221;</b>

&#8220;I have personally known Denver for several years now and have had the pleasure of closing on a number of transactions with him during that time. I find Denver to be honest, a man of integrity, dedicated to the industry, intelligent, very insightful, and most of all, passionate. He would be an asset by bringing his personal experience and understanding of the complex issues our industry faces. <b>As a 28 year veteran that has owned, developed, leased, and managed retail projects, he will be invaluable to the industry as we tackle the issues ahead.&#8221;</b>
