<span class="overtexthead">F. Denver McGarey</span><br>
President & Chief Executive Officer<br>
<a href="mailto:Denver@TheMcGareyGroup.com">Denver@TheMcGareyGroup.com</a>
<br><br>
F. Denver McGarey has been involved in the development, planning, merchandising and leasing of major award-winning retail projects throughout the United States and Japan for over thirty-five years. Throughout his career, Denver has established himself as a leader in the planning and execution of highly-complex retail projects and mixed-use campuses.
<br><br>
During the first decade of his career, Denver had been directly responsible for the development of over twenty retail projects in Metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, as junior partner with Dunlap & Magee, and later as a partner with its affiliate companies, Arizona Building and Development and Charles Dunlap & Company. The company was vertically integrated, featuring in-house leasing, construction, finance, project accounting, legal, marketing and public relations.
<br><br>
In 1989, Denver relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, and became Managing Director of National Leasing for Hill Partners, where he was bottom-line responsible for a large portfolio of institutionally-owned specialty, power center, regional and entertainment-based retail projects throughout the Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern United States. These projects were in excess of six million square feet, covering seven states. As Managing Director, Denver managed every aspect of a project's operation, including leasing, marketing, asset/property management, staffing, financial modeling and budgeting, capital improvement programs, and disposition strategies and execution. Sample projects include Jackson Brewery in New Orleans, Louisiana, Biltmore Fashion Park in Phoenix, Arizona (strategic planning), and Worthington Mall in Columbus, Ohio.
<br><br>
In 1996, Denver was recruited by Herbert S. Miller of Western Development Corporation and W. Lehr Jackson of Williams Jackson Ewing to join their joint venture with the Soros Global Fund, known as American Malls International, in the development of major urban-oriented retail projects in Japan. Frequent international travel was required to assist in multiple disciplines of client relations, planning, leasing and marketing of existing redevelopment projects and ground-up development. Denver was responsible for transactional communication with major U.S., Japanese and European retail, restaurant, entertainment and manufacturing brands on behalf of the venture.
<br><br>
In 1998, Denver shifted his focus to the planning and development of Gallery Place, a $240M 650,000sf mixed-use development in Downtown Washington, D.C., which was a joint venture between Western Development and The John Akridge Companies. Working closely with Herb Miller and Chip Akridge, Denver was involved in all aspects of the planning, architectural development and economic modeling, and secured and negotiated all major leases to anchor the retail component of the project.
<br><br>
Denver with his wife and partner, Chris Jennings McGarey, acted as the Exclusive Retail Consultant for Atlantic Station in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia. Atlantic Station is a 138-acre mixed-use development featuring 1.7 million square feet of retail, multiple hotel properties, Class-A office, and 6,000 residential units. In concert, Atlantic Station will eclipse 14 million square feet at full build-out.  The project has received international acclaim as a model of modern living and complex development execution. Today, McGarey Management Group is working in many of America's leading markets and is considered one of the foremost experienced and successful retail leasing and advisory companies in the shopping center industry.
